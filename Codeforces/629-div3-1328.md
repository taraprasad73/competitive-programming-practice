## [A. Divisibility Problem](https://codeforces.com/contest/1328/problem/A)
Simple question. Answer is (b - (a % b)) % b.

## [B. K-th Beautiful String](https://codeforces.com/contest/1328/problem/B)
For finding the pattern, the list can be divided into blocks. In each block the value of the first b is fixed.
```
-----
i = 1
aaabb
-----
i = 2
aabab
aabba
-----
i = 3
abaab
ababa
abbaa
-----
i = 4
baaab
baaba
babaa
bbaaa
-----
```
```
So, consider the position of first b corresponding to i.
i = 1, b is at n - 1
i = 2, b is at n - 2
...
i = i, b is at n - i

So, first we need to find this value of i, the iteration to which k belongs to. For example, if i = 4 for values of k from 7 to 10, for n = 5.

remaining values = k - i * (i + 1) / 2, because at each i, there are i * (i + 1) / 2 combinations
Second b's position = n - remaining + 1
```
In the implementation, the value of i is found with binary search which points to the block just before the block which contains k.
```cpp
int binary_search(int n, int k) {
    int lo = 0, hi = n;
    int ans = 0;
    while(lo <= hi) {
        ll mid = (lo + hi) >> 1LL;
        ll x = (mid * (mid + 1LL)) >> 1LL;
        if(x < k) {
            ans = mid;
            lo = mid + 1;
        } else {
            hi = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return ans;
}

int t; cin >> t;
while(t--) {
    int n, k; cin >> n >> k;
    int iteration = binary_search(n, k);
    int first_b_pos = n - iteration - 1;
    int remaining = k - (iteration * (iteration + 1LL)) / 2LL;
    int second_b_pos = n - remaining + 1;

    string ans(n, 'a');
    ans[first_b_pos - 1] = 'b';
    ans[second_b_pos - 1] = 'b';
    cout << ans << endl;
}
```

## [D. Carousel](https://codeforces.com/contest/1328/problem/D)
The answer to this problem is at most 3. Let's prove it by construction.

Firstly, if all ti are equal then the answer is 1. Otherwise, there are at least two different values in the array t so the answer is at least 2. If n is even then the answer is always 2 because you can color figures in the following way: [1,2,1,2,…,1,2]. If n is odd then consider two cases. The first case is when some pair of adjacent figures have the same type. Then the answer is 2 because you can merge these two values into one and get the case of even n. Otherwise, all pairs of adjacent figures have different types and if you consider this cyclic array as a graph (cycle of length n) then you can notice that it isn't bipartite so you need at least 3 colors to achieve the answer (color all vertices in such a way that any two adjacent vertices have different colors). And the answer looks like [1,2,1,2,…,1,2,3].
```cpp
int n; cin >> n;
vi a(n);
for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cin >> a[i];
}
vi color(n);
int ans;
if(count(ALL(a), a[0]) == n) {
    ans = 1;
    color.assign(n, 1);
} else if(n % 2 == 0) {
    ans = 2;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        color[i] = (i % 2) + 1;
    }
} else {
    ans = 3;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        color[i] = (i % 2) + 1;
        if(a[i] == a[(i + 1) % n]) {
            ans = 2;
            // merge these two to the same color, to make it similar to the even case
            color[(i + 1) % n] = color[i]; 
            for(int j = i + 2; j < n; ++j) {
                color[j] = ((j - 1) % 2) + 1;
            }
            break;
        }
    }
    if(ans == 3) {
        for(int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            color[i] = (i % 2) + 1;
        } 
        color[n - 1] = 3;
    }
} 
cout << ans << endl;
for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    cout << color[i] << " ";
}
cout << endl;
```
## [C. Ternary XOR](https://codeforces.com/contest/1328/problem/C)
Simple question. 
```
For 0 -> always use 0, 0
For 1 -> always use 0 and 1, assign the 0 to the larger among a and b
For 2 -> use 1 and 1 till both a and b are equal, after that use 2 and 0, 2 to the larger
```
Here's the code -
```cpp
int n; cin >> n;
string x; cin >> x;
string a(n, '1'), b(n, '1');
bool became_unequal = false; // a > b after this
for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if(x[i] == '0') {
        a[i] = b[i] = '0';
    } else if(x[i] == '1') {
        if(!became_unequal) {
            a[i] = '1';
            b[i] = '0';
            became_unequal = true;
        } else {
            a[i] = '0';
            b[i] = '1';
        }
    } else if(x[i] == '2') {
        if(!became_unequal) {
            a[i] = '1';
            b[i] = '1';
        } else {
            a[i] = '0';
            b[i] = '2';
        }
    }
}
cout << a << endl << b << endl;
```
